#### The folders in the directory are:  
- ***Data***: is the folder of both raw and processed data  
- ***Figuers***: is the folder of both Exploratory and final graphs  
- ***R code***: is the folder of both raw and final script  
- ***text***: is the folder of the final report PA!_template.Rmd  

#### Commit containing full submission:  
1. The code file *read_process.R* in R code/Final_code directory for read and process the dataset *activity.csv*. 
3. The code file *Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day_1.R* for make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and in the Figures/Final_figures directory *Figure 1.png* is the result of running the code file.  
3. The code file *mean_median_1.R* for calculating the mean and median number of steps taken each day and in Data/Processed_data, the *average_steps_per_day_1.csv* is the result.  
4. The file code *Time series plot of the average number of steps taken.R* for making a time series plot of the average number of steps taken and in the Figures/Final_figures directory *Figure 2.png* is the result of running the code file.  

5. In Data/Processed_data, the *Max interval across averaged days.csv* is 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps  
6. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data is in  R code/Final_code directory *imputing_ missing_values.R* is the file code.  
3. The code file *Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day_2.R* for make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and in the Figures/Final_figures directory *Figure 3.png* is the result of running the code file after the missing values are imputed.  
4. *panelPlot.R* is a panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends the Figures/Final_figures directory *Figure 4.png* is the result of running the code file. 
4. All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report *PA1_template.Rmd* in Text folder.
