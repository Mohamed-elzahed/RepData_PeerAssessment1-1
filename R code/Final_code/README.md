# The code files:  
-  ***Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day_1 and Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day_2***:
are both the code fileds for the histogram of the total number of steps taken each day for ignoring and imputtig the missing values.  
- ***imputting_missing_values.R***: The code file for imputtig the missing values strategy.
- ***interval_max_steps.R***: The code file for calculating which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps.  
- ***mean_median_1.R and mean_median_2.R***: are both the code files for calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day ignoring and imputing the missin values.
- ***panelPlot.R***: The code file for panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
